# X-Road Security Server Sidecar

X-Road Security Server sidecar is a Docker container that is optimized as a consumer Security Server, and intended to be installed as a sidecar next to a consumer information system. In other words, it runs in the same context (virtual host or e.g. Kubernetes Pod) as the consumer information system.

X-Road Security Server sidecar docker image contains a custom set of modules instead of xroad-securityserver:

- xroad-proxy
- xroad-addon-metaservices
- xroad-addon-wsdlvalidator
- xroad-autologin

The X-Road Security Server sidecar software is built from pre-built packages downloaded from the official X-Road repository at [https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-release-deb](https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-release-deb).

### 1.5 Installation

To install the Security Server sidecar in a local development environment, run the script setup_security_server_sidecar.sh providing the parameters in the order shown (reference data 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4):

  ```bash
  ./setup_security_server_sidecar.sh <name of the sidecar container> <admin UI port> <software token PIN code> <admin username> <admin password> (<remote database server hostname> <remote database server port>)
  ```

The script setup_security_server_sidecar.sh will:

- Create a docker bridge-type network called xroad-network to provide container-to-container communication.
- Build xroad-sidecar-security-server-image performing the following configuration steps:
  - Downloads and installs the packages xroad-proxy, xroad-addon-metaservices, xroad-addon-wsdlvalidator and xroad-autologin from the public NIIS artifactory repository (version bionic-6.22.0 or later).
  - Removes the generated serverconf database and properties files (to be re-generated in the initial configuration script).
  - Removes the default admin username (to be re-generated in the initial configuration script).
  - Removes the generated internal and nginx certificates (to be re-generated in the initial configuration script).
  - Enables health check port and interfaces (by default all available interfaces).
  - Backs up the read-only xroad packages' configuration to allow security server sidecar configuration updates.
  - Copies the xroad security server sidecar custom configuration files.
  - Exposes the container ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 4000 (admin UI), 5500 (proxy), 5577 (proxy OCSP) and 5588 (proxy health check).
- Start a new security server sidecar container from the xroad-sidecar-security-server-image and execute the initial configuration script, which will perform the following configuration steps:
  - Maps ports 4000 (admin UI) and 80 (HTTP) to user-defined ones (reference data 1.2).
  - Maps port 5588 (proxy health check) to the same host port.
  - Updates security server sidecar configuration on startup if the installed version of the image has been updated.
  - Configures xroad-autologin custom software token PIN code with user-supplied PIN (reference data 1.3).
  - Configures admin credentials with user-supplied username and password (reference data 1.4).
  - Generates new internal and admin UI TLS keys and self-signed certificates to establish a secure connection with the client information system.
  - Recreates serverconf database and properties file with serverconf username and random password.
  - Optionally configures the security server sidecar to use a remote database server.
  - Starts security server sidecar services.
  - Replace 'initctl' for 'supervisorctl' in 'xroad_restore.sh' for start and stop the services.
  - Create sidecar-config directory on the host and mount it into the /etc/xroad config directory on the container.

## 1.6 Installation with remote server configuration database

It is possible to configure the security server sidecar to use a remote database, instead of the default locally installed one. To do that, you need to provide the remote database server hostname and port number as arguments when running the setup_security_server_sidecar.sh script in the order described below. Before running the script, you must also set the environment variable XROAD_DB_PASSWORD with the remote database administrator master password:

  ```bash
  export XROAD_DB_PASSWORD=<remote database administrator master password>
  ./setup_security_server_sidecar.sh <name of the sidecar container> <admin UI port> <software token PIN code> <admin username> <admin password> <remote database server hostname> <remote database server port>
  ```

The following configuration is needed on the remote database server to allow external access to the remote PostgreSQL database from the security server sidecar:

- Edit the PostgreSQL configuration file in `/etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf` to enable listening on external addresses and to verify the port. NOTE: If you change these settings, the postgresql service must be restarted.

  ```bash
  [...]
    # - Connection Settings -

    listen_addresses = '*'  # what IP address(es) to listen on;
                            # comma-separated list of addresses;
                            # defaults to 'localhost'; use '*' for all
                            # (change requires restart)
    port = 5432             # (change requires restart)
  [...]
  ```

- Edit the PostgreSQL client authentication configuration file in `pg_hba.conf` to enable connections from outside localhost. Replace the IP `127.0.0.1/32` with `0.0.0.0/0`.

  ```bash
  [...]
  # IPv4 local connections:
  host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0            md5
  [...]
  ```

## 1.7 Volume support

It is possible to configure security server sidecar to use volume support. This will allow us to  create sidecar-config and sidecar-config-db directory on the host and mount it into the /etc/xroad and /var/lib/postgresql/10/main  config directories on the container.
For adding volume support we have to modify the docker run sentence inside the setup_security_server_sidecar.sh script and add the volume support:

`-v (sidecar-config-volume-name):/etc/xroad -v (sidecar-config-db-volume-name):/var/lib/postgresql/10/main`

For example:
  ```bash
  [...]
    docker run -v sidecar-config:/etc/xroad -v sidecar-config-db:/var/lib/postgresql/10/main -detach -p $2:4000 -p $httpport:80 -p 5588:5588 --network xroad-network -e XROAD_TOKEN_PIN=$3 -e XROAD_ADMIN_USER=$4 -e XROAD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$5 -e XROAD_DB_HOST=$postgresqlhost -e XROAD_DB_PORT=$postgresqlport -e XROAD_DB_PWD=$XROAD_DB_PASSWORD --name $1 xroad-sidecar-security-server-image
  [...]
  ```

### 1.8 Finnish settings
  To install the Security Server sidecar in a local development environment with Finnish settings, modify the image build in the setup_security_server_sidecar.sh changing the path "sidecar/Dockerfile" to "sidecar/fi/Dockerfile"

## 2 Security Server Sidecar Initial Configuration

### 2.1 Reference Data

 **Ref** | **Value**                                                | **Explanation**
 ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------
 2.1  | &lt;global configuration anchor file&gt; or &lt;URL&gt;     | Global configuration anchor file or provider URL (1) (2)
 2.2  | &lt;security server owner's member class&gt;<br>E.g.<br> COM - Commercial<br> ORG - Organisation            | Member class of the security server owner for the sidecar (2)
 2.3  | &lt;security server owner's member code&gt;                 | Member code of the security server owner for the sidecar (2) (3)
 2.4  | &lt;security server code&gt;                                | Security server code for the sidecar (4)
 2.5  | &lt;PIN for software token&gt;                              | Software token PIN code (same as ref. data 1.3)

Note (1): The global configuration provider's download URL and TCP port 80 must be reachable from the security server sidecar network.

Note (2): Reference items 2.1 - 2.3 are provided to the security server owner by the X-Road central server's administrator.

Note (3): The security server member code usually refers to the organization's business code, although there can be other conventions depending on the X-Road governing authority's rules.

Note (4): The security server code uniquely identifies the security server in an X-Road instance. X-Road instance's governing authority may dictate rules how the code should be chosen.

### 2.2 Configuration

To perform the initial configuration, navigate to the Admin UI address:

  ```bash
    https://SECURITY_SERVER_SIDECAR_IP:ADMIN_UI_PORT/
  ```

(reference data 1.10, 1.2) and accept the self-signed certificate. To log in, use the admin username and password chosen during the installation (reference data 1.4).

Upon first log-in, the system asks for the following information:

- The global configuration anchor file (reference data: 2.1).

Then, if the configuration is successfully downloaded, the system asks for the following information:

- The security server owner's member class for the sidecar (reference data: 2.2)
- The security server owner's member code for the sidecar (reference data: 2.3). If the member class and member code are correctly entered, the system displays the security server sidecar owner's name as registered in the Central Server
- The security server code for the sidecar (reference data: 2.4), it has to be unique across the whole X-Road instance.
- Software token PIN code (reference data: 2.5). The PIN will be used to protect the keys stored in the software token. The process xroad-autologin will automatically enter the PIN code after some time.

## 3 Key Points and Limitations for X-Road Security Server Sidecar Deployment

- The current security server sidecar implementation is a Proof of Concept and it is meant for testing and development purposes.
- The current security server sidecar implementation does not support message logging, operational monitoring nor environmental monitoring functionality, which is recommended for a service provider's security server role. This functionality will be included in future releases.
- The security server sidecar creates and manages its own internal TLS keys and certificates and does TLS termination by itself. This configuration might not be fully compatible with the application load balancer configuration in a cloud environment.
- The xroad services are run inside the container using supervisord as root, although the processes it starts are not. To avoid potential security issues, it is possible to set up Docker so that it uses Linux user namespaces, in which case root inside the container is not root (user id 0) on the host.
